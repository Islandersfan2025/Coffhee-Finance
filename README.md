# Encrypted Limit Orders
Encrypted Finance introduces encrypted limit orders by combining the **1inch Limit Order Protocol** with **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** via **FHE Solidity libraries**. This integration allows users to create limit orders where key order details (like price or amount) remain **encrypted on-chain**, preserving privacy until execution.

Key Features:

* **Privacy-preserving orders**: Order parameters are encrypted using FHE, so they cannot be read or front-run by third parties or bots.
* **Built on 1inch**: Leverages the battle-tested 1inch Limit Order Protocol for secure and efficient decentralized order execution.
* **FHE integration**: Uses FHE to enable computation over encrypted data, allowing validation and matching of orders without exposing sensitive info.

In essence, Coffhee enables **confidential DeFi trading** with **on-chain encrypted logic**, advancing both privacy and trustlessness in decentralized finance.
